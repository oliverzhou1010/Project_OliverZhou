"Senior Software Engineer, Orders Data Platform","Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
Job Description
We are the Orders Data Platform team, a team whose mission is to help merchants of all sizes gain insights from their sales data through a variety of interfaces. We sit at the center of critical domains and data flows, and we’re building a multi-layered platform to achieve our goals with Square-wide impact. We’re looking for a senior engineer who can help us build new platform features to dramatically improve user-facing search and reporting experiences at Square.
We provide a unified view of Orders/Orders-adjacent data at Square, and power a variety of interfaces for our teams and third-party developers to access that data. You’ll work with teams to understand requirements, and ensure the platform we’re building works across several distinct use cases.
To power that view of Orders, we’re also building a general-purpose Elasticsearch- and GraphQL-based search and reporting platform that can operate at Square scale.

The ideal fit for this role is someone who enjoys creating and innovating with data, is passionate about metrics and methods, and who is able to balance the need for technical complexity with user-facing simplicity. This person has a deep technical toolkit, but also knows that the highest value data products are not always the most complex.

Product- and business-minded: you enjoy using data to solve user pain points and business problems.
Strong ability to communicate technical outcomes to cross-functional audiences.
Ability to navigate (and bring structure to) ambiguity, with the ability to bring a project from 0 to 1.
Nice to haves:
(But not required!)
Experience evaluating the performance of ML models (not that this is not an ML-specific role, but you will work closely with ML Engineers).
Experience with data transformations using dbt.
Experience building customer-facing data products.
Experience working with product managers, engineers, and/or designers.
A final note — we highly encourage you to apply for this role, even if you don’t feel entirely qualified, or entirely sure. You never know!

Our Compensation Philosophy
Pave’s compensation philosophy is to target the 75th percentile of the market for both cash and equity at your job level. This means that the “mid point” of every band at Pave is the 75th percentile of the broader market.
Pave also has a merit-based philosophy when it comes to compensation increases. We run a performance cycle twice per year to evaluate employees’ performance. Higher than average performance ratings result in compensation increases to the upper end of the individual’s compensation range for their role. The result is that high performers at Pave are paid
above
the 75th percentile of the market at large.
Pave is committed to pay equity. If you get an offer from Pave, it will be based on your level as determined by your interview performance. And nothing else. We explicitly do not negotiate salary and equity to ensure that we aren’t introducing bias that could lead to pay inequities within the team between candidates who have different negotiation tactics.

Job Duration:
08+ Months with the possibility of an extension
Job Location:
Richmond, VA
Job Summary
Perform Traffic Data Analytics tasks like data acquisition and cleaning; processing; validation; fusion & conflation; analytics, reporting & visualization; prototype pilot projects; and ad-hoc analyses.
The Selected Program Analyst Traffic (Part-Time) Will Be Engaged In Various Aspects Of Traffic Data Analytics Tasks Including But Not Limited To The Following
Data acquisition, cleaning, and preparation tasks require working with many transportation and non-transportation data sets e.g. speed, volume, AADT(Average Annual Daily Traffic), road geometry and characteristics, socio-demographics data, posted speed limits, weather, work zone information, crash and incident data, pedestrian and bicycle data, and others, and obtaining those through different means such as graphical user interfaces, APIs, direct access to back-end databases either internally from third party vendor and archives. Data cleaning and preparation steps will be needed, especially for free-form text fields, and they may be different based on the data set and source.
Data fusion tasks require merging or aligning (fusing) data sets on the spatial(location) or temporal (point in time or similar period of year and time of day) dimensions, in a redundant (same attributes) or complementary (different attributes) fashion.
Data analysis and visualization tasks will require the incumbent to apply tried-and-true but also new and innovative methods to identify historical travel trends, conduct Before-and-After studies, perform congestion and reliability analyses for specified areas and time periods of interest, and identify locations and periods experiencing unusual traffic behavior. Analysis results will be presented in a format and at a level of detail appropriate for the audience, through interactive and static charts, graphs, and maps.
GIS and map conflation will require leveraging existing map conflation tools and algorithms, but in some cases development of new algorithms and methods may be necessary. Either way, manual checking and validation of conflation will be needed since conflation algorithms are not perfect and do not cover all real-life situations.
Some research to perform the above tasks will be needed. The research will include but not be limited to a literature review of transportation data analytics algorithms, investigating the feasibility and usability of incorporating new data sources into analytics algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of results, and traffic forecasting methods.
Required Skills
Data retrieval (UI, SQL, API)
Data Engineering (cleaning, preparation, validation)
Data analytics, integration, and visualization
Advanced Excel skills
Visualization platforms: Tableau, PowerBI
Scripting/coding for data science: Python, R
GIS tools: ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro

How you will make an impact
Opensignal’s business is built on data. As a member of the Data Science team, you will work in collaboration with our Engineering and Products teams to create, analyse, interpret and report on our Metrics to quantify the quality of experience of mobile network users around the globe.
The Data Science team are architects of numerous data-gathering and interpretation initiatives. For example, we released a mobile games experience metric, and previous years voice and video experience metrics - all firsts in the industry - while we continue to design new tests that are key to analysing the experience of mobile customers using a 5G connection under different architectures and frequencies.
You will model scenarios for producing new metrics as driven by our Product team and business stakeholders. You will need to think carefully and laterally, examining possible solutions whilst questioning if there is a better way of doing things. It's a process of iteration to get to the solution, in partnership with the wider technology teams.
Apart from designing new metrics, there is the work associated with collecting billions of data points every day, from our Apps and third-party Apps. A critical aspect of the team is to ascertain the quality of incoming data, understand likely causes of anomalies, build rules that sanitise the data, perform statistical analysis for our Marketing and Sales teams or external clients, and build tools that automate our Data Science analyses.
You will also get exposure to many other parts of the business, working closely with our Data Engineers, Android & iOS Engineers, QA Engineers and our Product Management functions.

Creating big-data analyses that are developed into new metrics and dashboard analytics for our mobile network clients.
Designing and implementing internal dashboards and analytics that explain our metrics development and provide actionable insights for customers.
Translating business and customer requirements to data science analyses, and communicating these effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Creating ad-hoc or automated analyses and developing effective models to evaluate the quality and integrity of our data and client deliverables.
Evaluating the robustness of recommendations and reproducing analysis, to influence the direction of product development within cross-functional teams.
Working cross-functionally with Mobile, Data Engineering & Product members to create improvements in the tools and techniques to help scale our analyses.
Desired Skills & Abilities
A passion for data interrogation and analytics, with advanced modelling, coding and analysis skills entailed in the role.

Competence in Data Science reproducibility best practices.
Ideally experience in continuous integration and the full Data Science pipeline.
Ideally experience with basic software tools and environments like git, shell or cloud storage.
Experience of working within an Agile environment, familiar with Agile methodology, working practices and ceremonies.
Comfortable collaborating within multidisciplinary teams, contributing to problem-solving sessions and actively seeking and actioning feedback.
Self-motivated, able to learn new techniques independently, make suggestions and research.
Able to perform at a high level remotely.
Curiosity and a desire to learn, a pre-requisite for the Data Science team.
Competent at describing the rationale and assumptions behind your work. We’re interested in the ‘why’ that sits behind the data product design, or analytical approach.

"Lead Data Scientist, Product Platform","Join The Team Redefining How The World Experiences Design.
Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.
Where And How You Can Work
Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.
What You’d Be Doing In This Role
As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.
At The Moment, This Role Is Focused On
Coaching and leading a team of data scientists and analytics engineers, helping them develop in their careers and keeping them engaged and motivated
Driving the data strategy in the group, coordinating closely with the Product Leads and Engineering Leads to drive and keep initiatives moving. Identifying the opportunities where your team can make the largest impact and you see it through
Finding insights that help us understand both Canva and our customers - we want you to be creative and insightful, rather than just throwing the usual metrics at the wall to see what sticks
Suggesting and running insightful experiments that will actually move our metrics - when we push tests to 100% we want to actually see the bump in the relevant graph
Building and maintaining dashboards for your group’s initiatives, and make them look really good - you don’t need to be a designer or have any design talent, you just need to want to build cool things
Owning projects, data models, dashboards, and other artefacts and keep them up-to-date and high quality in a hypergrowth environment
Using our giant databases to answer the sort of questions that sound really simple but turn out to be challenging (and fun!)
You're Probably a Match If
Demonstrable experience leading data specialists, defining team strategy, and data roadmaps.
Experience in communicating through data and dashboards and the ability to steer decisions with them.
Experience working with frontend performance based data sets.
Strong competency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
Experience wrangling and analysing data using Python or R
Experience with optimising product funnels, running experiments, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes
A grounding in mathematics / statistics and a bachelor's degree in a STEM area is preferred; but not required
Experience with very large data sets is a huge plus, but not required
Strong communication skills - verbal and written - be able to break down complex topics into simple solutions and ideas. Stakeholder management skills are vital in this role.
About The Team
Product Platform is 150+ people strong and made up of a diverse mix of engineers, product managers and product designers. The group owns many cross cutting functionalities including frontend performance, Canva’s design system and our mobile and desktop clients. Those have either a large user base, many internal stakeholders or both. Many of our strategic decisions around those concerns are driven by data.
What's in it for you?
Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.
Here's a Taste Of What's On Offer
Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
Check out lifeatcanva.com for more info.
Other Stuff To Know
We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.
Please note that interviews are conducted virtually.

Staff Data Scientist,"Why project44?
project44 optimizes the movement of products globally, delivering better resiliency, sustainability, and value for our customers. As the supply chain connective tissue, we operate the most trusted end-to-end visibility platform that tracks more than 1 billion shipments annually for the world’s leading brands. The undisputed leader in the market, project44 was named the Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, #1 in FreightWaves’ Freight Tech 25, and the Customer’s Choice in Gartner Peer Insights’ Voice of the Customer report. project44 is headquartered in Chicago with a diverse and fast-growing, global workforce.
Our data scientists have access to the data that tells the story of some of the supply chain disruptions that have been making the news over the last few years (COVID-19, Suez Canal blockage, increases in extreme weather, etc.). We can see that in our data and provide real-time solutions for our customers.
What Data Scientists Do Here
At the end of the day, project44 is a data company. Project44 has grown to a $1B+ valuation by making supply chain and logistics datasets available and visible to the people who need them. The next step is to extract insights from that data – and that’s where we come in. While some companies have data scientists whose primary focus is on making the organization smarter, our focus is on providing insights to our customers. We use all sorts of data (geospatial, time-series, etc…) to build models that predict the route that a shipment might take, estimate the time a truck/train/ship might arrive at its destination, and ultimately model the behavior of every “link” in the global supply “chain”. Our Data Scientists collaborate with engineers, product owners, and most importantly one another to contribute insights and data science best practices to all parts of the business.

Senior Applied Data Scientist,"Company Description
It all started with an idea at Block in 2013. Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic app, bringing a better way to send, spend, invest, borrow and save to our millions of monthly active users. With a mission to redefine the world's relationship with money by making it more relatable, available and accessible, at Cash App you'll have the opportunity to make a real-world impact with your career. Today, Cash App has thousands of employees around the world with a culture geared toward creativity, collaboration and impact. We've been a distributed team since day one, and continue to value working across time zones and continents both remotely and in our Cash App offices.
Our offices are great, but many of our roles can be done remotely from the countries where Block operates. We tailor our experience to champion our employees' creativity and productivity wherever they are.

Job Description
The Cash App Quantitative Finance Team is an intellectually diverse team of machine learning modelers, statisticians, economists, data scientists, former strategy consultants, and data engineers focused on applying graph analytics, statistics, econometrics, and machine learning algorithms to solve business problems for executives within Cash App and the broader Block organization.
The team has answered some of the most complex questions around how our network is formed and evolves, why our customers churn or re-engage with the platform, and why they choose to move money into or out of the platform. The outputs of our team are used to drive high level company strategy across product development, marketing, and financial strategy. We partner across the broader Block ecosystem and work directly with Foundational Engineering, Data Engineering, marketing, customer insights, and finance. In 2024 we are going to reimagine strategy and automation within Cash, serving as a guidepost for the overall Block organization.
As an Applied AI and Data Science Lead within our team, you will work with colleagues across Cash and Block to deliver statistical models to forecast the business. You will use state of the art machine learning and statistical methods to model time series that are key to the success of our business. In addition to developing these models, you will have the opportunity to explore the applications of novel machine learning and statistical tools within our business (e.g. generative AI, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian methods, etc.), work on complex graph/network problems, and have exposure to the highest levels of leadership across Block.
Because this is such a unique role, we are looking for someone who can own the end-to-end model development process (requirements, data, development, implementation) while understanding the business context, and who has the ability to communicate to senior leaders.
Qualifications
You Have:
An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, Mathematics or a related technical field
PhD plus 2 years (or Master plus 4 years) industry working experience in developing machine learning / statistical models to solve real world problems (e.g. classification, NLP, regression, panel models, time series, etc.)
Outstanding written and oral communication skills to present and explain the functioning of the models to exercise influence amongst Cash and Block Executives
Experience using business intuition on what drives adoption of certain products to develop predictive models
A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns
Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation
Nice to have:
Familiarity or interest in graph theory problems / network science
Familiarity with consumer behaviors in the context of financial services
Open Source Contributions / Academic publications
Intuition on how the macroeconomic environment shape customer behavior

Data Analyst / Scientist,"Department:
Consultancy
Employment Type:
Full Time
Location:
Guildford
Description
As a Data Analyst or Data Scientist at Actica, you will have the opportunity to use and develop your data skills to unlock business problems for a wide range of high-profile UK public sector organisations. Your help will enable them to get the maximum benefit from their investments in technology, information and facilities, and in doing so, play a key role in nationally critical projects which make a real difference to people's everyday lives.
Actica recognises that Data Analytics and Data Science are different disciplines, though closely related. When we talk about Data Analytics, we think primarily of exploiting existing data to generate deeper insights and support faster, more assured decision-taking.
When we talk about Data Science, our focus is on scoping, designing, and developing innovative ways to capture and exploit new or previously unexploited data. Actica colleagues tend to move between the two, depending on experience, interest, and client requirements.
In either role, you would be expected to translate business problems into data queries, applying data standards and principles to add fresh understanding. You should be able to provide advice on how best to set up data exploitation to assure success, including consideration of a range of different languages and toolsets. You will need to relate your work to the clients' wider data environment, so understanding of some of the key principles of data architecture is also important.
This role will require you to work flexibly as part of teams of varying sizes and compositions – including data specialists and others with different skillsets. Over time, you may move on to leading assignments and take responsibility for supervising direct reports whilst ensuring the overall success of the engagement.
Actica Consulting is a growing Technology Consultancy that works on some of the most nationally critical technology projects. We specialise in delivering complex projects to limited timescales. Our customers include a wide range of public sector organisations; such as, the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, HM Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, Police Forces, Fire Services and the NHS; as well as a range of national and international companies across the private sector.
We are recruiting in order to facilitate continued growth of the business and as a result multiple positions are available across Consultant, Senior Consultant, and Principal Consultant grades. The advertised role is for employment on a permanent basis; however, we are happy to discuss Associate (contract) opportunities if that is your preference.
Collaborate with application teams to assess existing on-premises or legacy applications and plan their migration to the cloud.
Have a high-level knowledge of security and compliance requirements throughout the design process. Then implement appropriate security controls, such as identity and access management, encryption, and network security, to protect data and resources.
Optimize existing cloud-based systems for performance and scalability, understanding bottlenecks and then implement solutions such as caching mechanisms, load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities efficiently.
Collaboration with cross-functional teams, including developers, operations personnel, department stakeholders.
Candidates must be eligible and willing to gain high level UK Security Clearance to apply for this position.
Key Responsibilities
Working either individually or – more usually - as part of a larger team, you will undertake assignments such as:
Creating genuinely useful data outcomes to help deliver client goals in major business transformation programmes;
Hands-on analytics, including working with clients, users and other team members to address data availability and quality issues before they become blockers;
Carrying out 'pre-discovery' to establish which business problems, or which parts of business problems, are best addressed through data analytics / data science;
Translating business problems into data exploitation queries;
Specifying data analytics and data science environments;
Understanding data flows, i.e., which parts of the organization generate data, which require data to function, how data flows are managed, and how data changes in transition;
Collaborating and coordinating with multiple departments, stakeholders, partners, and external vendors.
Skills, Knowledge And Expertise
We work predominantly within the UK Defence and Public Sectors so experience within those sectors is desirable, preferably in roles which have used data to solve business problems. The fast-moving nature of the Public Sector technology environment, together with the need to resource multiple, ad-hoc assignments, also requires our data analysts and data scientists to be quick thinkers, proactive and self-motivated – with the ability to apply a structured approach to often unfamiliar subject matter.
The following attributes and areas of experience will make you particularly suited to this role with Actica:
Coding eg expertise in Python or R;
Collaborative, team-based development;
Cloud analytics platforms eg relevant AWS and Azure platform services;
Data visualisation tools eg Power BI, Qlik Sense;
Data science approaches and tooling eg Hadoop, Spark;
Data engineering approaches;
Database management, eg MySQL, Postgress;
Government Digital Service approaches, ie the Government Service Design Manual and the Service Standard;
Software development methods and techniques eg Agile methods such as SCRUM;
Software change management, notably familiarity with git;
Public sector best practice guidance, eg ITIL, OGC toolkit.
You will also need to hold or be eligible to hold UK security clearance; more information about the clearances can be found here: United Kingdom Security Vetting: clearance levels - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)
Benefits
25 days of paid leave per annum plus 8 UK bank holidays

"Senior Data Scientist, Clinical Signals","Who We Are. . .
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, Mass. General), technologists (athenahealth, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron, WalMart Health), healthcare innovators (Oscar, Aledade, VillageMD, Stellar, Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Cigna, United) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States’ future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens, one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, our solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk sharing more available and readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.
What We Hope You Can Do. . .
We are seeking a brilliant Senior Data Scientist with a track record of propelling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems.

"Senior Data Scientist, Natural Language Interfaces","At Klaviyo, we value the unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives each Klaviyo (we call ourselves Klaviyos) brings to our workplace each and every day. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success and appreciate the experiences each person brings beyond the traditional job requirements. If you’re a close but not exact match with the description, we hope you’ll still consider applying. Want to learn more about life at Klaviyo? Visit careers.klaviyo.com to see how we empower creators to own their own destiny.
About The Team
As part of the Klaviyo Data Science team, you work alongside dozens of other Data Scientists to help solve high-impact problems facing our customers and business partners. We’re looking for someone to help support the team responsible for developing customer-facing, chat-based features in the Klaviyo app. This is a relatively new team working with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other techniques to improve the user experience. You’ll be coming in as one of our primary data scientists on the team and will have the chance to radically impact how customers use some of the core features of the Klaviyo app on a daily basis.
Listen to our data science team podcast at https://medium.com/klaviyo-data-science and learn more about our technical culture at https://klaviyo.tech
About The Role
We’re looking for a motivated Data Scientist to join our team and help build chat-based models for customers into the Klaviyo app. We’re looking for someone who can build, train, and deploy models, work directly with technical and non-technical stakeholders to scope projects, and adjust to learnings on the fly. The ideal candidate has a strong background in data science, statistics, and machine learning, and is motivated to learn about the areas they work in deeply enough to gain expertise, but is also efficient and solution-oriented.
The right candidate will have a solid fundamental grasp on a number of data science modeling and problem-solving techniques, and should be comfortable working in a fast-paced research and development setting. We’re focused on shipping early and often. We prefer iterative solutions that are incrementally better to a long-debated “perfect” solution.
You will work alongside a multifaceted team of product managers, designers, engineers, and other data scientists to focus on integrating natural language based tools into the Klaviyo experience. Think ChatGPT but for our marketing platform. The work you do will have a direct and measurable impact on Klaviyo customers and how they interface with our platform.
As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll also have a strong role in mentoring other members of the team. You’ll review their math and statistics work as well as their code to ensure high quality, and you’ll share your knowledge with the team to help others learn.
How You’ll Have An Impact
You will work alongside product managers and design researchers to understand customer pain points and scope potential data science solutions to these problems
The machine learning models you build will fundamentally change the way that Klaviyo customers interact with our platform
You will have an opportunity to own projects from end to end, from scoping to maintenance post-delivery
Your work will require you to read up on recent advancements in LLMs and NLP which will help Klaviyo build up expertise in this space
You will execute on technical work, with an emphasis on the ability to work iteratively and adapt to what the data tells us and/or changes in business/customer needs
You will choose the right solution for the problem at hand rather than relying on “one-size-fits-all” approaches
You will collaborate with other data science team members and participate in cross-team statistical and code reviews
What We’re Looking For
5+ years professional data science experience
Strong fundamental understanding and deep experience with a variety of statistical and/or machine learning algorithms (e.g. regression models, tree-based methods, clustering, neural networks) as well as ways to evaluate and validate the performance of those models
Proficiency in writing high-quality code in Python for production deployment, conducting code reviews, and deploying to a production environment
Ability to collaborate radically and communicate clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
A motivated problem solver with the ability to work independently in a research-driven capacity - first by thinking critically about problems and brainstorming potential solutions and then by implementing and testing these ideas on actual data
Bachelor’s or advanced degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science or other relevant quantitative discipline
Nice To Have
Proven track record of collaborating with business stakeholders to successfully address customer and business challenges through data-driven approaches
Advanced knowledge of SQL including complex query formulation and optimization
Strong foundation in formal research methodologies, with the ability to design, implement, and analyze experiments to promote data-driven decision-making
The pay range for this role is listed below. Sales roles are also eligible for variable compensation and hourly non-exempt roles are eligible for overtime in accordance with applicable law. This role is eligible for benefits, including: medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, 401(k), flexible paid time off and company-paid holidays and a culture of learning that includes a learning allowance and access to a professional coaching service for all employees.
