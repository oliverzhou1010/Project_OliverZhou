Our Values
Our team embodies our ten core principles and if these principles speak to you – we'd love to talk with you.
Mission Driven - We know that financial well-being has a dramatic impact on an individual's quality of life. We are passionate about helping people in this domain.
Extreme Ownership - We are responsible for the results to our clients, teammates, and shareholders. We own everything in our domain that affects these results.
Boldness - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thinking big inspire results. We would rather fail at the meaningful than succeed at the trivial.
Ruthless Prioritization - We want to do more than we possibly can. We must be disciplined on how to use our precious money, people, and time. That means saying no to a lot of good ideas so we can focus on the most important thing.
Integrity - We do the right thing. This trust must never be broken.
Effectiveness - We do what's needed to deliver the intended results. Whether that requires disciplined process or scrappy implementation, we find a way.
Team Oriented - We work collaboratively to achieve more. We respect, trust, and support one another.
Transparency - We use simple and clear communication to share information so that people have the context to make good decisions.
Make Forward Progress - Something is better than nothing. We make incremental improvements on our path towards perfection. Crawl, walk, run, and then sprint.
Resiliency - We understand that any big goal comes with ambiguity, change, and setbacks. We adapt and keep going.

Data Engineer – up to £150-200k total compensation,"Big tech is fragile and career outlook right now is very uncertain. What about working at a hedge fund where their growth is almost certain?
This data engineering team hired multiple people last year – most from big-tech – and plan to do the same this year.
A large portion of your work will technically be non-finance, with the main finance focused work completed by other teams. The real-world, complex data engineering problems are all yours.
You’ll be joining a team that builds and has built thousands of ingestion pipelines, with data coming from every single potential avenue it possibly can. To get the best understanding of an investment, all data points are considered. You’ll bring the data into the business, build the data infrastructure around it and deliver the data to the right person in the business to build their investment models.
Tech is also completely flexible. Most of the work is done within Python, C# and Scala with a range of databases. Snowflake is widely used, as are Docker and Kubernetes for containerisation. ETL and ELT tech are also used every day, primarily Airflow, Spark, Hive and a lot more.
You’ll need to come from a strong academic background with some commercial experience in a data heavy software or data engineering role. Financial experience of some kind would be a huge plus, but absolutely not a requirement. Experience with as much of the tech stack above is preferred and most likely, but you don’t need experience with all. Picking up new tech will be part of your job.
This is a $60 billion plus fund, where being at the cutting edge of technology in general, let alone finance, is key for them. With this amount of ambition, it’s why their bonuses can be some of the biggest in the industry. First year total compensation could be as high as £200,000 and this has the potential to get better year on year, based on your performance.
When in the office you have a fully catered canteen with a Michelin standard chef, barista coffee, a gym and more.
Want to explore (or to continue exploring) high-tech in the Hedge Fund world?
No up-to-date CV required initially, we can work on updating it together if need be.

On the Global Data Science team, we are seeking a Senior Data Scientist to unearth new insights the business can action against and drive value.
The global data science team is embarking on an exciting journey to harness and enhance our decision-making capability that will empower us to maximize the growth potential of our trusted food brands. Forging strong business relations, this role will require you to partner with different functions to exercise knowledge of descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques to develop decision models that drive business goals.
This position is a hybrid role and could be located in Battle Creek, Michigan area or in the Naperville, Illinois area.
A Taste Of What You’ll Be Doing
Data Modelling–Our goal is to advance the business’decision-making capability across the commercial and supply chain space whilst taking existing modelling methods to the next level. You will be a part of the development of optimized decision models accounting for uncertainty through probabilistic (or other) methods with the results being verified by the business process.

You will lead the team across certain initiatives, previous leadership experience is a must.
Stakeholder engagement - Working with business subject matter experts to see the world through their eyes will form a large component of the role where piloting proof of concept models using limited to very large and unstructured data sets is often required. As is often the case, results can go against current belief, you will need to be comfortable to expose the rationale in easy-to-understand terms for the business.
Data Analytics-This role will require at times, research to be conducted across multiple disciplines. Providing recommendations across the broader IT function on big data infrastructure along with research and thought leadership across the business domain are just a couple of examples where your expertise will be required in proposing and simplifying complex paradigms. Not all the data will be readily available, so understanding what exists internally and is relevant whilst leveraging new data collection processes (inc. externally) will undoubtedly be required.
Training and Mentoring–Along with end-user training of the models or tools you develop, coupling your domain and modelling expertise will be called upon to provide guidance, training and problem-solving assistance to other team members whilst mentoring less-experienced individuals.

Junior Data Engineer,"About Citylitics
Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets
What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.
Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.
Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

Wildfire Prevention Data Scientist CrowdDoing Volunteer
-Prevention derivatives is driven by the thesis that there is an under-valuation of passive risk (or the cost of inaction) and an under-prioritization of positive risk. Correspondingly for wildfires as an example, there is an under-recognition of the potential shared value upside of preventative action through social innovation and social interventions (such as goats & sheep that prevent wildfires). CrowdDoing.world's aim is to guarantee positive risk through leveraging existing liabilities to allow for the implications of prescriptive analytics to be financed. The under-pricing of passive risk means that liabilities are treated as either costs of doing business or un-predictable risks even for entirely preventable risks. Risk management offices have been too biased towards avoiding taking the wrong risks rather than ensuring that institutions make their own luck by seizing the abundant positive risk opportunities in social innovation. Meanwhile, the bias against positive risk leaves social innovations not to get adopted even if there would be remarkable benefits to all stakeholders if they were adopted
In the framework of Prevention Derivatives, we want to create a predictive machine learning (ML) model that for a given geographical region will estimate likely savings (losses) due-to protection (damages) of stakeholders’ properties, business profits, common health, and regional ecology resulting in applying risk prevention solutions (or doing nothing instead). Goal of these notes is to analyze ML model’s design, offer a potential improvement and to discuss existing approaches for data collection, and training and testing the model. It is important to notice that the model is applied to the entire selected or target region. Therefore, a geographical region R is the smallest unit we apply modeling to.
This is a volunteer opportunity provided by VolunteerMatch, in partnership with LinkedIn for Good.

Data Scientist (IV) – Generative AI,"Locations include Spring, Texas (preferred location), and US remote.
Typically need at least Master's degree and minimum 0-2 years full-time relevant work experience.
The Team
We are a growing centralized team helping HP take advantage of new AI/ML technology, especially around Generative AI and large language models. We engage with business units to advise and prototype solutions, and we develop and run software applications for internal use.
The Role
As a Data Scientist with a focus on Generative AI you will work on multiple engagements across HP involving large language models and other new Generative AI capabilities. Beyond our team, you will work with business stakeholders and developers from other business units. Your primary focus and mindset is to help deliver business solutions to our (mostly internal) customers. You are expected to stay up to date on important new Gen AI papers and releases, but note that this is not an AI research role.
Skills And Profile
Knowledge of data science and machine learning core skills.
Experience with NLP, Large Language Models, LLM prompt engineering, vector databases, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and search engines.
Good computer science skills. Experience in a software development team is a big plus, especially with business applications in a cloud environment.
Tools you may use include Azure services such as Azure Machine Learning and Azure prompt flow, as well as python, langchain, streamlit, docker, git, and elastic search.
Some experience from a large complex organization is a plus.
Ability to participate in meetings with a multitude of stakeholders and communicate in a crisp manner. Mastery in English is required.
You enjoy explaining technical concepts (such as LLM's) to a non-technical audience.
You propose pragmatic solutions that are as simple as possible, which sometimes mean that no Gen AI component is necessary.
Interest in working in a distributed team with diverse backgrounds.
The recent AI progress is disruptive, and our team is in the midst of it. As a consequence, day-to-day priorities, tasks, and team structure may change rapidly. We are looking for somebody who thrives in such an environment. The role is not a fit if you value ""business as usual"".
Education And Length Of Experience
For this position, we prefer at least a relevant Master's degree (e.g. Computer Science) or demonstrated competence, and a minimum of 6-10 years experience.

"Senior Data Scientist, Clinical Signals","Who We Are. . .
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, Mass. General), technologists (athenahealth, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron, WalMart Health), healthcare innovators (Oscar, Aledade, VillageMD, Stellar, Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Cigna, United) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States’ future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens, one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, our solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk sharing more available and readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.
What We Hope You Can Do. . .
We are seeking a brilliant Senior Data Scientist with a track record of propelling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to provide better care to our members by identifying opportunities to prevent unnecessary medical spend and improve patient care management. You should be a strategic and analytical thinker, an effective communicator, an expert in analytical and data infrastructure systems, and comfortable performing sophisticated modeling exercises independently. We are looking for experts in both causal inference and machine learning, so you should have a deep familiarity with and passion for these technologies. We are building a best-in-class patient management platform so that physicians can better prioritize care. For more information, see our white paper on the Signal-Action Framework.
What a Senior Data Scientist Means To Us...
Translate the company’s goals and vision into its strategy and operations by conducting sophisticated quantitative analyses while informing decisions about our infrastructure and approach.
Help us change the future of work for doctors in America by applying state of the art technology solutions, including machine learning and causal inference.
Develop and deploy sophisticated algorithmic approaches to prioritizing patient care in a clinical setting.
Measure the causal impact of interventions, including regression, multilevel modeling, propensity score matching, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs.
Partner effectively with Engineering, Product, Clinical Operations, Analytics, and Client Performance teams toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.
Who You Are…
Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field and/or 8+ years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.
SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages (Python, R, Julia, Scala, matlab). Python is our current primary language and is preferred.
A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in ML domains.
Experience collaborating with data engineering and analytics teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline. Familiarity with dbt preferred, but open to additional cloud ETL tools.
Thoughtful collaborator, able to manage multiple demanding stakeholders, assimilate complex information quickly, and scope work in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.
Prior experience working with healthcare data in any part of the industry (payor, provider, pharmacy, etc.); familiarity with population health data is preferred but not essential.
Experience mentoring and collaborating with data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers to create a well-rounded data culture. Experience providing feedback on data science methods and approaches in related workstreams, and experience presenting your work and core competencies to a broader data team.

Like other divisions within the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), WIC builds its program by addressing social determinants of health. WIC impacts the life course by promoting health practices that can ultimately improve life outcomes often experienced by vulnerable communities.
WIC serves babies and children up to age five, pregnant women, and new mothers. Dads, grandparents, foster parents of young children, and working families are welcome at WIC too!
Monthly, nearly one million WIC participants can find support at one of 84 local agencies that offer services at more than 500 sites throughout California. WIC participants can redeem their food benefits at approximately 3,800 grocers that are authorized to serve WIC families.
In 2019 - 2020, the WIC Division implemented an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card called the California WIC Card and a new management information system that allows WIC participants to be served more efficiently.

Our Compensation Philosophy

Pave also has a merit-based philosophy when it comes to compensation increases. We run a performance cycle twice per year to evaluate employees’ performance. Higher than average performance ratings result in compensation increases to the upper end of the individual’s compensation range for their role. The result is that high performers at Pave are paid
above
the 75th percentile of the market at large.
Pave is committed to pay equity. If you get an offer from Pave, it will be based on your level as determined by your interview performance. And nothing else.

Slack enables people all over the world to communicate and collaborate together. Teams of all scales — from the world’s largest public companies to the smallest of startups — use Slack to get work done, so we take performance and reliability very seriously. A taste of our scale:
The average user spends over 10 hours connected and 2.5 hours active in Slack every single day
1.5 billion+ messages are sent per month, half of those outside the United States
Every day we see over 10M+ daily active users, over a billion web requests, and 10s of billions of database queries.
For millions of people, Slack is the primary communication tool they use at work all day long. They expect it to be exceptionally reliable and fast, all the time.
Infrastructure at Slack
We operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second. Teams in our group maintain and build the lower levels of our stack, including:
Edge services
Data Stores and Caches
Real-time messaging
Asynchronous background job processing
We know we’ve done our job correctly when
none of our users think about us.
We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are incredibly performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, Slack just works seamlessly.
Slack's API and web backend is built on PHP/Hack, our backend services are written in Java and Go, and we use Vitess as our storage engine. Our architecture is constantly evolving to handle millions more users. You can read about how we scaled our datastores with Vitess, how we respond to incidents, and much more on our blog.
What you will be doing:
Operate and enhance our large, highly-available database infrastructure, utilizing technologies such as MySQL and Vitess.
Develop tools to enable self-service and self-managing capabilities of our database infrastructure so that other teams can operate full-stack while rapidly building new features for our customers.
Collaborate with engineering teams on their database storage needs, and advise them throughout the development lifecycle.
Write code to capture database performance, and create tools and dashboards to provide actionable insight into that data.
Participate in our on-call rotation and collaborate with our operations team to triage and resolve production issues.
Support FedRAMP and DoD SRG activities.
What you should have:
Have been working in data storage, core infrastructure, or distributed system-owning teams with increasing responsibilities for 5+ years.
Have professional experience using Go, PHP/Hacklang, Python, Ruby, or Java.
Write code that can be easily understood by others with an eye towards clarity and maintainability. Collaborate with other teams to integrate new features of your platform or adopt self-service features.
Operated at least one distributed system, at scale and in a team environment. Some examples include: a relational database like MySQL/Postgres, or systems like Kafka, Cassandra, or ElasticSearch.
Deployed server software on Linux, and then operated it at scale. You’ve debugged its problems, and analyzed and optimized its performance.
Have experience operating cloud infrastructure, especially AWS.
Are familiar with deployment automation/configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, or Terraform.
Are a very strong communicator. You’re excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with different audiences.
Are curious how things work; when they break you are eager and able to help fix them.
Infrastructure is a diverse and inclusive team that treats their colleagues exceptionally well. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and thus it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas.
